Comprehensive Judge Validation System Testing
===========================================

This script tests the comprehensive judge validation system that addresses concerns about 
fake/non-existent judges returning results. Tests validation response types, sources,
and distinguishes between fake and real judges.

SPECIFIC TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Individual Judge Analysis with Validation (/api/litigation/judge-insights/{judge_name})
2. Judge Comparison with Validation (/api/litigation/judge-comparison) 
3. Validation Response Types (NO_INFORMATION_FOUND, HIGH_CONFIDENCE, MODERATE_CONFIDENCE, LOW_CONFIDENCE_ESTIMATED)
4. Validation Sources and reference links
5. Error handling with fake judges vs real judges
6. Test fake judges like "ZZZ Fictional Judge" vs realistic names like "John Smith"
7. Verify validation response structures with is_verified, validation_sources, validation_summary, reference_links
8. Test jurisdiction parameters (US, India, international)
9. Test error handling for empty judge names or special characters
