"""
Comprehensive Backend Testing for Judge Comparison Functionality
==============================================================

This script tests the new judge comparison functionality as requested:

Test Coverage:
1. POST /api/litigation/judge-comparison - Judge comparison endpoint with sample data
2. GET /api/litigation/judge-insights/{judge_name} - Existing judge insights endpoint
3. Integration Test - Complete workflow testing
4. Error Scenarios - Edge cases and error handling

Focus Areas:
- Verify judge comparison API endpoint with exact sample data from request
- Test response structure includes: judges_compared, comparative_metrics, recommendations, analysis_date, confidence_score
- Test error handling for less than 2 judges
- Test with different case types
- Verify existing judge insights endpoint still works (no regressions)
- Test complete workflow: Get insights for Judge 1 → Get insights for Judge 2 → Compare both judges
