# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "You are an expert in text-to-speech (TTS) systems and user interface design. I want to improve the current audio generation feature by allowing users to choose from different voice options before generating speech audio from the script. After the script is generated, and before generating the audio, the system should prompt the user to select from multiple voice options (e.g., male, female, robotic, various accents). The selection should be presented through a dropdown menu or modal interface with clear labels (e.g., \"Male – US\", \"Female – UK\"). Once a voice is selected, the system should generate the audio using that specific voice model. Replace the current default male voice setup with a flexible voice engine that supports multiple voices. Use a free TTS engine with voice support like Edge-TTS."

**CONTINUATION REQUEST:** When the "Enhance Prompt" button is clicked, the system should  to generate the three categorized enhanced prompts: Emotional Engagement Focus, Technical Excellence Focus, Viral Potential Focus. However, each enhanced prompt should be significantly upgraded in depth, clarity, and structure — making them fully optimized for generating high-quality, ready-to-use scripts. The enhancements should go beyond surface-level rewording and incorporate advanced prompt engineering techniques tailored to each focus area.

**NEW FEATURE REQUEST:** In the Generated Script section, please add a new button labeled "Enhance Image Prompt" positioned below the "Listen" button. When clicked, it should automatically enhance all the image prompts associated with each shot by adding more descriptive text, visual and contextual details, and structuring the prompt in a way that is easily understood by any AI image generators. The goal is to produce high-quality, contextually accurate images when used with AI image generation tools.

**CURRENT ISSUE (January 2025) - RESOLVED:** User reported unable to generate images - after clicking "enhance image prompt" and then "generate images", error occurs: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'document')". The root cause was that window.open() was returning null due to popup blockers, and the code was trying to access .document on null object. FIXED by implementing proper error handling and fallback inline image gallery display.

ROOT CAUSE: The error 'Cannot read properties of null (reading 'document')' was occurring because window.open() was returning null (due to popup blockers), and the code was trying to access newTab.document.write() on a null object. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) Added proper error handling to check if window.open() returns null, 2) Implemented fallback inline image gallery when popup is blocked, 3) Added new state variable 'showInlineGallery' to control inline display, 4) Created complete inline gallery component with same functionality as popup version, 5) Added downloadImage function for inline gallery, 6) Gallery automatically scrolls into view when popup is blocked, 7) Users can close inline gallery with close button. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Modified openImageGallery function to use try-catch block, check for null newTab, and gracefully fallback to inline display. Added comprehensive inline gallery with grid layout, image preview, fullscreen click, download buttons, and proper styling. The fix ensures image generation always works regardless of browser popup settings. Users will now see generated images either in new tab (if allowed) or inline within the application (if popup blocked)."

      message: "🎉 SCRIPT AUDIO FILTERING ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED (January 2025): Fixed critical TTS issue where AI was reading entire script including production notes instead of only dialogue content. ISSUE IDENTIFIED: When users clicked 'Listen' → 'Generated Audio', TTS was reading everything including: AI image prompts, production notes ('Okay, here's a script designed...'), technical specifications, and metadata, instead of only the actual dialogue content that should be spoken. ROOT CAUSE: The extract_clean_script function wasn't handling modern AI-generated script formats with [DIALOGUE:] markers and extensive production metadata. COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: 1) ENHANCED SCRIPT PARSING: Added specialized extract_dialogue_only_script() function to handle modern script formats with [DIALOGUE:] and **[DIALOGUE:]** markers, 2) IMPROVED FILTERING LOGIC: Enhanced detection of script start patterns, added comprehensive skip logic for AI image prompts, production notes, and technical specifications, 3) DIALOGUE EXTRACTION: Precisely extracts only content after [DIALOGUE:] markers while removing speaker directions like '(Intense, slightly hushed tone)', 4) BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Maintained support for older script formats while adding new capabilities. TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Sample script correctly filtered from full production script to only dialogue content ('That knot in your stomach? The one that whispers, Don't even try'? We're facing it *together*, right now.'), ✅ TTS API generating proper audio (42,000+ chars base64) for dialogue-only content, ✅ All production metadata, AI image prompts, and technical notes successfully filtered out. Users will now hear only the actual spoken dialogue when generating audio from their scripts, exactly as intended for video production."
